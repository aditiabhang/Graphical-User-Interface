### About GUI Projects

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) folder contains my assignment portions of my project I did during the MS course - CS 5389.501 'Graphical User Interfaces'. The course covered both abstract and practical treatments of using graphics to implement interactive computer/human interfaces. Includes a survey of the major GUI standards and tools.

- *SORRY for the oldie moldy UI!!!* 🙃 Our professor actually required us to use **only** **OLD version** of QT and opengl. Hence, the UI looks quite outdated straight from the 90's! 😅

- Enjoy the antique look!!!! 🕰️😁
