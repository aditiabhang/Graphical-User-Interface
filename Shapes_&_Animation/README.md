### Shapes & Animation with opengl pop-window : 

- This program is an extension for the Software Radio QT.
- It has an extra Tetrahedron 3D animation program merged using Dock Widget. 
- Implemented a Tetrahedron application presents a 3D tetrahedron, with each face drawn using a different color. 
        
        
    - In the tetrahedron program, the user can rotate the tetrahedron by pressing the mouse button and moving it. 
    - Moreover, The user can set the color of a tetrahedron face by double-clicking it and choosing a color from the QColorDialog that pops up.
- n-gon function is used to draw a circle and other polygonal shapes. Whereas, for drawing a cube I have made use of glVertex3f(x, y, z). 
- For adding colors to all shapes, I have used glColor3f(x, y, z) function.

### New features:

- 3D Tetrahedron shape on separate dock.
- Animation on shape using mouse activity.
- QColorDialog that pops up to select and change color of the side of shape.
- Gradient color on line.
- Heptagon and Octagon (2 shapes extra than expected)
